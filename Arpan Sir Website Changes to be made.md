Computational and Experimental demonstration on water filtration and de-clogging of water filter using sound and vibration  

This project entails simulating water filtration process through RO as well as normal filter. Acoustic de-clogging will be studied experimentally as well as using simulation. 



Developing impedance tube for Acoustic Characterization of materials. 

This project works on developing in house impedance tube for acoustic characterization of materials.
