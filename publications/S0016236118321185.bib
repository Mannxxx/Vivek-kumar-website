abstract = {The transportation sector of the present-day world is facing severe problems like increasing global pollution and continuous depletion of conventional energy resources; both at alarming rates; which has motivated the researchers to look for alternative fuels and study various aspects of clean burning and sustainable fuels. The vibration of the engines during the combustion is one crucial aspect, as it defines the overall ride quality and comfort of an automobile. In this work, the authors have studied dual fuel combustion using a constant speed diesel engine, operated using hydrogen and diesel. The experimental studies are carried at the load of 25%, 50% and 75% with the substitution of diesel with hydrogen for the energy share of 0%, 5%, 10% and 20%. The effect of hydrogen addition on the combustion characteristics, vibrations and acoustics in the engine is investigated. In this study, marginal pernicious effects of hydrogen addition on the in-cylinder pressure are observed, particularly at lower loads. However, the vibration and noise level sees a reduction with hydrogen addition. The effect of combustion characteristics on noise and vibration parameters is carried out to understand their correspondence. Hydrogen supplementation is found beneficial for noise and vibrations level at low and mid-range loads.}
